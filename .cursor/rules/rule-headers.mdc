recommendations:
  - All rule files must have a properly formatted header section
  - Headers must be enclosed between triple dashes (---)
  - Required header fields: description, globs
  - Optional header fields: alwaysApply (defaults to false)
  - Headers must be at the very beginning of the file

header_format:
  required:
    - description: A brief, clear description of what the rule does
    - globs: File pattern(s) where this rule should apply (uses .gitignore syntax)
  optional:
    - alwaysApply: Boolean value (true/false) indicating if rule should be applied without explicit mention
