# ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NEVER RESTART VITE SERVER ⚠️

<rule>
name: vite_server_management_critical
description: NEVER restart the Vite development server under any circumstances

recommendations:
  - NEVER restart the Vite development server (npm run dev --prefix frontend)
  - The user ALWAYS runs the Vite server in a separate terminal
  - Frontend code changes are AUTOMATICALLY picked up by the running Vite server
  - NEVER make any terminal calls that involve starting a new Vite instance
  - FOCUS exclusively on making code changes without restarting services

actions:
  - DO NOT run npm commands that would start a new Vite instance
  - DO NOT suggest restarting the Vite server
  - INSTEAD, inform the user that changes are automatically applied
  - RECOMMEND refreshing the browser if needed to see changes
  - ASSUME the frontend server is already running - always

metadata:
  priority: critical
  version: 2.0
</rule>

## Special Instructions

This rule takes precedence over all other rules. Under absolutely no circumstances should a new Vite development server be started. The user already has the Vite server running in a separate terminal.

Violating this rule by running `npm run dev --prefix frontend` or similar commands will cause significant frustration as it will interfere with the user's development environment.
