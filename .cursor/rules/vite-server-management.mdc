# Vite Server Management Rule

<rule>
name: vite_server_management
description: Guidelines for managing the Vite development server in this project

recommendations:
  - Do not restart the Vite development server (npm run dev --prefix frontend)
  - The user is running the Vite server in a separate terminal
  - Frontend code changes will automatically be picked up by the running Vite server
  - Focus on making code changes without restarting services

actions:
  - Instead of restarting the Vite server, inform the user that changes are automatically applied
  - Recommend refreshing the browser if needed
  - Avoid running npm commands that would start a new Vite instance

metadata:
  priority: high
  version: 1.0
